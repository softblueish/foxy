# A program that has a chance of withered foxy jumpscaring you every keypress
## How to use
You just run the exe and it'll start working immediately as a background service!
You can change the % chance in ``chance.conf``
This program requires you have SDL3 installed and are also running Windows (due to the heavy use of transparent windows), sorry Linux users.
## How to build
``g++ .\main.cpp -lSDL3 -mwindows -o foxy.exe``
